 Tools for investigating Ramsey numbers and 2-colorings on undirected, unweighted graphs

 ## Usage

 That's awful nice of you to consider this library but you probably shouldn't use it. If you must,
 it is both an embeddable library and a command line wrapper. Compile it yourself and go wild. It
 has a reasonably useful help file.
